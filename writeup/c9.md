# Writing a C Compiler - Chapter 9 - in Zig

<!-- Done Date: 2025-05-27 -->

After [eight](c8.md) grueling (not really) chapters of [Writing a C Compiler](https://norasandler.com/2022/03/29/Write-a-C-Compiler-the-Book.html), time to implement more assembly instructions. Functions! Linkage! Commas!

---

## Lexer, AST, and Parser

Lexer just has a comma now. I thought about adding the comma operator but that didn't seem worth the trouble.

The AST has two new additions. Function call expressions and function declarations (which are rebranded and improved function definitions)! Other changes include how the structures themselves are defined. A program is now a _list_ of function declarations, instead of just one. How about that?

These are the new AST nodes. I am not sure these compile or not yet, which I will find out when I am done with the parser. The use of `SegmentedList` is discussed a couple of chapters ago as a more Arena-friendly collection type.

```zig
pub const Prgm = struct {
    funcs: std.SegmentedList(FuncDecl, 0),
};

pub const Block = struct {
    body: std.SegmentedList(BlockItem, 0),
};

pub const BlockItem = union(enum) {
    D: Decl,
    S: Stmt,
};

pub const Decl = union(enum) {
    F: FuncDecl,
    V: VarDecl,
};

pub const FuncDecl = struct {
    name: []const u8,
    params: std.SegmentedList(Identifier, 0),
    block: ?Block,
};

pub const VarDecl = struct {
    name: Identifier,
    init: ?*Expr,
};

pub const Expr = union(enum) {
    // snip --
    func_call: struct { Identifier, std.SegmentedList(Expr, 0) },
};

// This was implemented last chapter fixing the Segmentation Fault!
pub const Identifier = union(enum) {
    name: []const u8,
    idx: utils.StringInterner.Idx,
};
```

It is going to be annoying fixing all the type errors throughout. Nonetheless, the parsing grammar for these new node types are going to change significantly. Here is. This is the new, tentative, `parse_prgm`. I am not sure this is entirely correct yet.

```zig
pub fn parse_prgm(
    arena: std.mem.Allocator,
    tokens: *lexer.Tokenizer,
) Error!ast.Prgm {
    var funcs: std.SegmentedList(ast.FuncDecl, 0) = .{};

    while (tokens.next()) |next_token| {
        tokens.put_back(next_token);
        const func_decl = try parse_func_decl(arena, tokens);
        try funcs.append(arena, func_decl);
    }

    return .{ .funcs = funcs };
}
```

`parse_func_decl` is the same as the old `parse_func_def`, but with optional parameters and an optional body. Ok maybe not the same, it is a behemoth. And all this is going to get significantly more complex when adding different types than `int`.

```zig
fn parse_func_decl(
    arena: std.mem.Allocator,
    tokens: *lexer.Tokenizer,
) Error!ast.FuncDecl {
    // same old
    try expect(.type_int, tokens);
    const name = try expect(.identifier, tokens);

    // new stuff !!
    var params: std.SegmentedList(ast.Identifier, 0) = .{};
    { // params
        try expect(.l_paren, tokens);
        const next_token = tokens.next() orelse
            return error.SyntaxError;
        // labelled switch to loop over mutliple parameters.
        params: switch (next_token.tag) {
            // old bahaviour is this:
            .keyword_void => try expect(.r_paren, tokens),

            // new optional parameters
            .type_int => {
                const ident = try expect(.identifier, tokens);
                try params.append(arena, .{ .name = ident });
                const next_next = tokens.next() orelse
                    return error.SyntaxError;

                // loops back here. this would be sginifcantly more annoying
                // to write without labeled switch
                switch (next_next.tag) {
                    .comma => {
                        try expect(.type_int, tokens);
                        continue :params .type_int;
                    },
                    .r_paren => {},

                    // could just retunr here but where is the fun then?
                    else => continue :params .invalid,
                }
            },
            else => return error.SyntaxError,
        }
    }
    const block = block: {
        const peeked = tokens.next() orelse
            return error.SyntaxError;

        switch (peeked.tag) {
            .semicolon => break :block null,
            .l_brace => {
                tokens.put_back(peeked);
                break :block try parse_block(arena, tokens);
            },
            else => return error.SyntaxError,
        }
    };

    return .{ .name = name, .params = params, .block = block };
}
```

There is one big item left, which is `BlockItem`, which can be a function declaration as well as a variable declaration, and it is not possible to know which is which from the token `type_int` as done before.

The most straightforward way to implement it in the current code base is as follows: look for an `type_int` token, verify there is an identifier token afterwards, _without_ recording it, then see what the third token is. If it is a `semicolon` or an `equals`, it is a variable; if it is a parenthesis, it is a function; otherwise it is illegal. Then the parser is rewinded to the `int` and the correct function is called. In later chapters, with global variables, it will be apparent that the only place which only accepts one type of declarations is the `for` loop statement, but I will cross that bridge when I get to it.

```zig
fn parse_decl(
    arena: std.mem.Allocator,
    tokens: *lexer.Tokenizer,
) Error!ast.Decl {
    const int_token = tokens.next() orelse
        return error.NotEnoughJunk;
    if (int_token.tag != .type_int) return error.SyntaxError;
    _ = try expect(.identifier, tokens);

    const new_token = tokens.next() orelse
        return error.NotEnoughJunk;

    tokens.put_back(int_token);
    switch (new_token.tag) {
        .semicolon, .equals => return .{ .V = try parse_var_decl(arena, tokens) },
        .l_paren => return .{ .F = try parse_func_decl(arena, tokens) },
        else => return error.SyntaxError,
    }
}
```

Parsing function calls is a new challenge. Previously, any identifier is immediately assumed to be a variable. But now, if the identifier is followed by parenthesis, it could be a function call with an arbitrary number of parameters. The new `identifier` case exhibits a serious case of rightward drift.

```zig
.identifier => {
    const next_token = tokens.next() orelse
        return error.NotEnoughJunk;
    const name = tokens.buffer[current.loc.start..current.loc.end];

    switch (next_token.tag) {
        .l_paren => return .{ .func_call = .{
            .{ .name = name },
            try parse_args(arena, tokens),
        } },
        else => {
            tokens.put_back(next_token);
            return .{ .@"var" = .{ .name = name } };
        },
    }
},

// elsewhere:
fn parse_args(
    arena: std.mem.Allocator,
    tokens: *lexer.Tokenizer,
) Error!std.SegmentedList(ast.Expr, 0) {
    // assumes l_paren already consumed
    var ret: std.SegmentedList(ast.Expr, 0) = .{};

    const current = tokens.next() orelse
        return error.NotEnoughJunk;

    args: switch (current.tag) {
        .r_paren => return ret,
        .comma => {
            const expr = try parse_expr(arena, tokens, 0);
            try ret.append(arena, expr);

            const n_token = tokens.next() orelse
                return error.NotEnoughJunk;
            continue :args n_token.tag;
        },
        else => { // only actually relevant for the first argument.
            tokens.put_back(current);
            continue :args .comma;
        },
    }
}
```

## Semantic Analysis

This is a bit more involved than usual this chapter. In addition to variable resolution, the compiler needs to do type checking! Do all declarations of functions (which _can_ repeat), have the same number of parameters?

Starting with the easier stuff, the identifier resolution pass should handle the new function syntax. Start with function calls. Here is the added part in `resolve_expr`.

```zig
.func_call => |*f| {
    if (bp.variable_map.get(f.@"0".name)) |entry| {
        f.@"0" = .{ .idx = entry.name };
        var iter = f.@"1".iterator(0);
        while (iter.next()) |item|
            try resolve_expr(bp, item);
    } else return error.Undeclaredfunction;
},
```

Resolving function declarations had me move the creation of the main variable map back into `resolve_prgm` instead, and create a new inner map for every function. Also, I need to update the `Entry` type of the variable map. This is the new `Entry`.

```zig
const Entry = struct {
    name: utils.StringInterner.Idx,
    scope: enum { local, parent } = .local,
    linkage: enum { none, external } = .none, // <-- new
};
```

Then this is `resolve_func_decl`, and the inner parameters resolution, which is really just a cheap copy of `resolve_var_decl` itself rebranded `resolve_decl`.

```zig
fn resolve_func_decl(
    bp: Boilerplate,
    func_decl: *ast.FuncDecl,
) Error!void {
    if (bp.variable_map.get(func_decl.name)) |prev|
        if (prev.scope == .local and prev.linkage != .external)
            return error.DuplicateFunctionDecl;

    try bp.variable_map.put(bp.gpa, func_decl.name, .{
        .name = try bp.strings.get_or_put(bp.gpa, func_decl.name),
        .scope = .local,
        .linkage = .external,
    });

    var variable_map = try bp.variable_map.clone(bp.gpa);
    defer variable_map.deinit(bp.gpa);

    var iter = variable_map.valueIterator();
    while (iter.next()) |value|
        value.* = .{
            .name = value.name,
            .scope = .parent,
            .linkage = value.linkage,
        };

    const inner_bp = bp.into_ineer(&variable_map);

    var iter = func_decl.params.iterator(0);
    while (iter.next()) |param| {
        // a cheap imitation of `resolve_var_decl`
        // should pribably be in its own function.
        if (inner_bp.variable_map.get(param.name)) |entry|
            if (entry.scope == .local)
                return error.DuplicateVariableDecl;

        const unique_name = try inner_bp.make_temporary(param.name);
        try inner_bp.variable_map.put(inner_bp.gpa, param.name, .{ .name = unique_name });

        param.* = .{ .idx = unique_name };
    }

    if (func_decl.block) |*block|
        try resolve_block(inner_bp, null, block);
}
```

One more thing, there is need to check that block level function declarations have no body. I am going to do that in `resolve_block`.

```zig
fn resolve_block(
    bp: Boilerplate,
    current_label: ?utils.StringInterner.Idx,
    block: *ast.Block,
) Error!void {
    var iter = block.body.iterator(0);
    while (iter.next()) |item| switch (item.*) {
        .S => |*s| try resolve_stmt(bp, current_label, s),
        .D => |*d| switch (d.*) {
            .F => |*f| if (f.block) |_|
                return error.IllegalFuncDefinition
            else
                try resolve_func_decl(bp, f),
            .V => |*v| try resolve_var_decl(bp, v),
        },
    };
}
```

Before delving into type checking, the book suggests to run the test suite, but expect a number of failures. Thankfully, I can check the individual folders separately using the eye test, without running the test suite in the official manner, I can tell that the compiler is passing all the right files it should at this stage, even the ones in `invalid_types`.

## Type checking

The Book has the type checking done in its own pass. At first, I tried just stuffing the type checking logic right into the same identifier resolution pass. But the actual problem was that I needed a separate data structure anyway, since function declarations have to match even when they are in different scopes. So I am still doing it in the same run, but with a separate data structure.

The type checking consists mostly of the following: not using the same identifier for both `int`s and functions, making sure functions always have the same number of parameters in all declarations, and make sure a function is not defined (with a body) twice.

A new data structure would be needed to stuff this info, global throughout the whole file.[^linker] A hashmap taking the unique identifiers as keys and their types as values. The type is either an integer or a function with defined arity (number of parameters). I also need to track whether a function has been defined or not.

[^linker]: Type errors between different files is very pointedly a not-my-problem. It is a linker error, while this is a compiler.

```zig
const TypeMap = std.AutoHashMapUnmanaged(
    u32,
    Type,
);

const Type = union(enum) {
    int,
    func: struct {
        arity: usize,
        defined: bool,
    },
};
```

Then adding a pointer to it to `Boilerplate`, and adjusting `resolve_prgm` as follows.

```zig
pub fn resolve_prgm(
    gpa: std.mem.Allocator,
    strings: *utils.StringInterner,
    prgm: *ast.Prgm,
) Error!void {
    var variable_map: VariableMap = .empty;
    defer variable_map.deinit(gpa);

    var type_map: TypeMap = .empty;
    defer type_map.deinit(gpa);

    const bp: Boilerplate = .{
        .gpa = gpa,
        .strings = strings,
        .variable_map = &variable_map,
        .type_map = &type_map,
    };

    var iter = prgm.funcs.iterator(0);
    while (iter.next()) |item|
        try resolve_func_decl(bp, item);
}
```

What follows next is lots of annoying boilerplate. I must make sure every time I add something to a `variable_map`, I am adding its new name (if any) to `type_map`. Hairier than usual logic, but should try to straighten it out before stuffing it in a `Boilerplate` method.

For example, in `resolve_finc_decl`, adding a name to `variable_map` and `type_map` is done as follows:

```zig
{
    const nname = try bp.strings.get_or_put(bp.gpa, func_decl.name);
    try bp.variable_map.put(bp.gpa, func_decl.name, .{
        .name = nname,
        .scope = .local,
        .linkage = .external,
    });
    const gop = try bp.type_map.getOrPut(bp.gpa, nname.real_idx);
    if (gop.found_existing) {
        if (gop.value_ptr.* != .func or
            gop.value_ptr.func.arity != func_decl.params.count())
        {
            return error.TypeError;
        } else if (gop.value_ptr.func.defined and
            func_decl.block != null)
        {
            return error.DuplicateFunctionDef;
        }
    } else gop.value_ptr.* = .{ .func = .{
        .arity = func_decl.params.count(),
        .defined = func_decl.block != null,
    } };
}
```

A similar thing to do in `resolve_var_decl`, and inside the small tidbit in `resolve_func_decl` that reeolves parameters. This is how it looks like.

```zig
{
    const gop = try bp.type_map.getOrPut(bp.gpa, unique_name.real_idx);
    if (gop.found_existing) {
        if (gop.value_ptr.* != .int) {
            return error.TypeError;
        }
    } else gop.value_ptr.* = .int;
}
```

There does not seem enough shared logic right now to try and DRY these. Maybe later. What is left is checking these things in function calls and variable declarations. They are both very funny looking.

```zig
.@"var" => |name| {
    if (bp.variable_map.get(name.name)) |un| {
        if (bp.type_map.get(un.name.real_idx).? == .int) // unwrap optional
            expr.* = .{ .@"var" = .{ .idx = un.name } }
        else
            return error.TypeError;
    } else return error.UndeclaredVariable;
},
.func_call => |*f| {
    if (bp.variable_map.get(f.@"0".name)) |entry| {
        const t = bp.type_map.get(entry.name.real_idx).?;
        if (t == .func and
            t.func.arity == f.@"1".count())
        {
            f.@"0" = .{ .idx = entry.name };
            var iter = f.@"1".iterator(0);
            while (iter.next()) |item|
                try resolve_expr(bp, item);
        } else return error.TypeError;
    } else return error.UndeclaredFunction;
},
```

I _think_ this should be it. I checked for functions being defined twice/ I checked that functions should be functions and types should be types. I checked all functions with the same name should have the same arity. `zig build` returns no errors. What is left?

The proof of the pudding is in the test suite. Time to run the test suite. (which now applies `--latest-only` by default as not to take _too_ long.)

```sh
% paella ❱ zig build submit -- --chapter 9 --stage validate
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 61 tests in 157.089s

OK
```

_Phew_. Mind you this does not mean the logic is correct. It just means it is failing the ones it should fail and passing the ones it should pass. The full test suite passes as well, which is cool.

I took the time to refactor out the common logic between function parameters and variable declarations. Zig's `comptime` allows some tricks that Rust would torture me for,[^const] forcing me to use a trait or some weird amalgamation of const generics. It turned out most of the logic is for identifiers, except for initializers in variable declarations. The new function follows.

[^const]: When will Rust have enums as proper const generics? Please, Rust.

```zig
fn resolve_var_decl(
    comptime T: enum { param, @"var" }, // anoynmous types yay
    bp: Boilerplate,
    item: switch (T) { // can simply be `if` but this is more readable i think
        .@"var" => *ast.VarDecl,
        .param => *ast.Identifier,
    },
) Error!void {
    const identifier = switch (T) { // pulling out the common logic
        .@"var" => &item.name,
        .param => item,
    };
    if (bp.variable_map.get(identifier.name)) |entry| if (entry.scope == .local)
        return error.DuplicateDecl;

    const unique_name = try bp.make_temporary(identifier.name);
    try bp.variable_map.put(bp.gpa, identifier.name, .{ .name = unique_name });

    { // TYPE CHECKING
        const gop = try bp.type_map.getOrPut(bp.gpa, unique_name.real_idx);
        if (gop.found_existing) {
            if (gop.value_ptr.* != .int)
                return error.TypeError;
        } else gop.value_ptr.* = .int;
    }

    identifier.* = .{ .idx = unique_name };

    if (T == .@"var") // logic unique to declarations
        if (item.init) |expr|
            try resolve_expr(bp, expr);
}

// called like this, inside `resolve_func_decl`
while (params.next()) |param|
    try resolve_var_decl(.param, inner_bp, param);
```

I ran the test suite again (and the eye tests) after this and everything seems to work out.

## Internal Represntation

After a long drought, finally time to update the IR syntax tree and generation. Which means new assembly stuff later. Couldn't the Book stick to adding more control flow constructs for ever? Maybe function calls can be implemented by just jumping around. Is that a thing?

The syntax tree updatss mirror the AST's.

```zig
const Identifier = utils.StringInterner.Idx; // type alias

pub const Prgm = struct {
    funcs: std.ArrayListUnmanaged(FuncDef), // <--
};

pub const FuncDef = struct {
    name: Identifier,
    params: std.ArrayListUnmanaged(Identifier), // <--
    instrs: std.ArrayListUnmanaged(Instr),
};

pub const Instr = union(enum) {
    func_call: struct {
        name: Identifier,
        args: std.ArrayListUnmanaged(Value),
        dst: Value,
    },

    // rest of the owl
};
```

And the rest is pretty much the same, sans a few updates to the pretty printers and deinitializers. Note that there are no function declarations, as they are discarded in this stage after being done with the type checking.

`prgm_emit_ir` is simply a small update from the one-function version to the many-functions version, skipping over declarations without bodies

```zig
pub fn prgm_emit_ir(
    alloc: std.mem.Allocator,
    strings: *utils.StringInterner,
    prgm: *const ast.Prgm,
) Error!ir.Prgm {
    var funcs: std.ArrayListUnmanaged(ir.FuncDef) = try .initCapacity(
        alloc,
        prgm.funcs.len,
    );

    var iter = prgm.funcs.constIterator(0);
    while (iter.next()) |f| if (f.block) |_| { // skip empty declarations
        const fir = try func_def_emit_ir(alloc, strings, f);
        try funcs.append(alloc, fir);
    };

    return .{ .funcs = funcs };
}
```

`func_def_emit_ir` is also almost exactly the same, except that the identifiers are moved over.

```zig
fn func_def_emit_ir(
    alloc: std.mem.Allocator,
    strings: *utils.StringInterner,
    func_def: *const ast.FuncDecl,
) Error!ir.FuncDef {
    const name = try strings.get_or_put(alloc, func_def.name);

    var params: std.ArrayListUnmanaged(utils.StringInterner.Idx) = try .initCapacity(
        alloc,
        func_def.params.count(),
    );
    var iter = func_def.params.constIterator(0);

    while (iter.next()) |param|
        try params.append(alloc, param.idx);

    var instrs: std.ArrayListUnmanaged(ir.Instr) = .empty;
    const bp: Boilerplate = .{
        .alloc = alloc,
        .strings = strings,
        .instrs = &instrs,
    };

    try block_emit_ir(bp, &func_def.block.?);
    try instrs.append(alloc, .{ .ret = .{ .constant = 0 } });

    return .{ .name = name, .params = params, .instrs = instrs };
}
```

Function call expressions are new, even though they follow the same pattern as all other expressions.

```zig
.func_call => |f| {
    var args: std.ArrayListUnmanaged(ir.Value) = try .initCapacity(
        bp.alloc,
        f.@"1".count(),
    );

    const dst = .{ .variable = try bp.make_temporary("fn") };

    var iter = f.@"1".constIterator(0);
    while (iter.next()) |e| {
        const v = try expr_emit_ir(bp, e);
        try args.append(bp.alloc, v);
    }

    try bp.append(.{ .func_call = .{
        .name = f.@"0".idx,
        .args = args,
        .dst = dst,
    } });

    return dst;
},
```

The last thing left to do here is to make sure that functon declaration as block items are skipped as well.

```zig
fn block_emit_ir(
    bp: Boilerplate,
    block: *const ast.Block,
) Error!void {
    var iter = block.body.constIterator(0);
    while (iter.next()) |item| switch (item.*) {
        .S => |*s| try stmt_emit_ir(bp, s),
        .D => |d| if (d == .V) try var_decl_emit_ir(bp, &d.V), // <-
    };
}
```

### Small Detour Back to Type Checking

I am honestly not quite sure about some decisions up to now. For example, if function declarations are discarded, why are their parameters given unique identities at all? Maybe I should go back and simply check the count (and ideally the types, but there are no types in here). This would change the end of `resolve_func_decl` to the following, instead of the if statement only encasing the last line. Since the count is checked earlier

```zig
if (func_decl.block) |*block| {
    var params = func_decl.params.iterator(0);
    while (params.next()) |param|
        try resolve_var_decl(.param, inner_bp, param);

    try resolve_block(inner_bp, null, block);
}
```

This passes all validations tests, except one.

```c
/* Duplicate parameter names are illegal in function declarations
   as well as definitions */
int foo(int a, int a);

int main(void) {
    return foo(1, 2);
}

int foo(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Ah well. Amusingly, at least according to the LLM I asked, `int foo(int, int)` _is_ a legal declaration. Anyway, this was a failed detour.

## Assembly Generation

This is the first serious brush in the Book with the System V ABI, the most common binary interface for Unixes. As there are currently no types more complex than `int`, all the compiler needs to worry about is stuffing parameters in the right registers. (And for function bodies, retreiving them from the right registers). The IR has not concerned itself with this, relying on the surrounding passes to make sense out of it.

In my Rust implementation, I used clever iterator combinators to write the logic for this section. I am kind of curious to see how it will turn out in Zig.

The first step, as usual, is to update the assembly syntax tree. A program needs to be redefined as a list of functions, and there are new instructions and new registers. Some necessary refactorings should be timed now as well. This is `assembly.Prgm`.

```zig
pub const Prgm = struct {
    funcs: std.ArrayListUnmanaged(FuncDef),

    pub fn fixup(
        self: *@This(),
        alloc: std.mem.Allocator,
    ) !void {
        for (self.funcs.items) |*func| {
            // functions called here changed from taking *Prgm to *FuncDef
            // ideally this should live under FuncDef, but this is fine for now
            const depth = try pass_pseudo.replace_pseudos(alloc, func);
            try func.instrs.insert(alloc, 0, .{
                .allocate_stack = @abs(depth),
            });
            try pass_fixup.fixup_instrs(alloc, func);
        }
    }
```

The new instructions are simple additions. However, I am using two type aliases here: `Depth` for an unsigned version of stack depth, and `Identifier` for `utils.StringInterner.Idx`.

```zig
allocate_stack: Depth, // old
dealloc_stack: Depth,

push: Operand,
call: Identifier,
```

And aside from the new Registers, which I will not bore you with, this is pretty much it.[^honesty] Implementing the codegen is the next step. parameters in function definitions need to be taken from their correct register and stack positions; and function calls need to stuff them there. `prgm_to_asm`, the main entry point, is straightforward.

[^honesty]: To be honest, and for all chapters, I am skipping most of the reading and jumping through to the tables at the end of the section to implement the functions. I assume that is what the tables are for.

```zig
pub fn prgm_to_asm(
    alloc: std.mem.Allocator,
    prgm: ir.Prgm,
) !assembly.Prgm {
    var funcs: std.ArrayListUnmanaged(assembly.FuncDef) = try .initCapacity(
        alloc,
        prgm.funcs.items.len,
    );

    for (prgm.funcs.items) |func|
        try funcs.append(
            alloc,
            try func_def_to_asm(alloc, func),
        );

    return .{ .funcs = funcs };
}
```

For functions, it is slightly different. The first six parameters should be passed in these registers in this specific order: `DI`, `SI`, `DX`, `CX`, `R8`, and `R9`. Remaining arguments are pushed into the stack in _reverse order_. So normally, I will just assign a constant for them registers.

```zig
const REGISTERS: [6]assembly.Operand.Register =
    .{ .DI, .SI, .DX, .CX, .R8, .R9 };
```

In `func_def_to_asm` itself, a zipped `for` loop is perhaps the most straightforward way of doing this. The first section is simple enough. And since the remaining paramters are pushed into the stack at function call in reverse order, they are in the correct order here. Starting from a 16 `stack` offset, they are moved one by one. Luckily, this same loop can be used!

```zig
for (func_def.params.items, 0..) |param, idx|
    if (idx < REGISTERS.len)
        try instrs.append(alloc, .{ .mov = .init(
            .{ .reg = REGISTERS[idx] },
            .{ .pseudo = param },
        ) })
    else {
        const offset = (idx - REGISTERS.len + 2) * 8; // 16, 24, etc
        try instrs.append(alloc, .{ .mov = .init(
            .{ .stack = @intCast(offset) },
            .{ .pseudo = param },
        ) });
    };
```

Implementing function calls is a lot more involved. First, the stack needs to be aligned properly at 16, as per the System V ABI. Copying the passed in expressions to the input registers is easy, but reversing the rest of them requires some shenanigans. First is to have a stack allocated array with the maximum possible size because it is unknown at the outset what the size of the returned slice could be.

[^registers]: The Book's pseudocode gives different instructions to add if the IR value is converted to an immediate value, register, or a pseudo value. The weird part here is that, well until chapter 15 (where I stopped last time), the IR value is never converted to a register at this stage. This could be something in preparation for the optimizations in Part 3.

```zig
// the return is of unknown size.
// maximum possible size is parameter count * 2 + 4
var ret: std.ArrayListUnmanaged(assembly.Instr) =
    try .initCapacity(alloc, c.args.items.len * 2 + 4);
```

Then calculate the amount of arguments in the stack and the needed padding to 16. Zig has a saturating subtraction operator `-|` that is perfect for this.

```zig
const depth = c.args.items.len -| REGISTERS.len;
const padding: assembly.Instr.Depth =
    if (depth % 2 == 0) 8 else 0;
if (padding > 0)
    try ret.append(alloc, .{ .allocate_stack = padding }); // 1
```

The numbering in the comments is me keeping track of instructions that do not depend on parameters count. After that comes putting the values in their respective registers, and the stack.[^registers]

```zig
for (c.args.items, 0..) |arg, idx| {
    if (idx >= REGISTERS.len) break;

    try ret.append(alloc, .{ .mov = .init(
        .{ .reg = REGISTERS[idx] },
        value_to_asm(arg),
    ) });
}
for (0..depth) |idx| {
    const v_ir = c.args.items[c.args.items.len - 1 - idx];
    const v_asm = value_to_asm(v_ir);
    switch (v_asm) {
        .imm, .reg => try ret.append(alloc, .{ .push = v_asm }),
        else => try ret.appendSlice(alloc, &.{
            .{ .mov = .init(v_asm, .{ .reg = .AX }) },
            .{ .push = .{ .reg = .AX } },
        }),
    }
}
```

I think this should work. `0..depth` will be .. nothing, and the loop will not run. If it is larger, it starts from the last item (at index `len - , 1`), then subtracts the current index of the loop. And finally, dealing with the return value, and returning the slice.

```zig
// emit call instruction
try ret.append(alloc, .{ .call = c.name }); // 2

const bytes_to_remove = 8 * depth + padding;
if (bytes_to_remove != 0)
    try ret.append(alloc, .{ .dealloc_stack = bytes_to_remove }); // 3

try ret.append(alloc, .{ .mov = .init(
    .{ .reg = .AX },
    value_to_asm(c.dst),
) }); // 4

return ret.items;
```

Doing the eye test for codegen, I quickly noticed something stupid. I am moving the register's value to an immutable. Oops.

```c
int add(int x, int y);

int main(void) {
    return add(1, 2);
}
// PROGRAM
// 	FUNCTION main
// 		allocate	4
// 		allocate	8
// 		mov	DI -> imm 1
// 		mov	SI -> imm 2
// 		call	.Ladd
// 		deallocate	8
// 		mov	AX -> stack -4
// 		mov	stack -4 -> AX
// 		ret
// 		mov	imm 0 -> AX
// 		ret
```

Fixing that by switching two lines, the eye test passes fine. The test suite does not hit any errors (and, as a reminder, does not test beyond success a nd failure).

After that comes the annoying fixup pass adjustments. The depth returned by `replace_pseudos` is adjusted to save the depth of each function in a field in the function definition. And also, when allocating, rounding that up to the nearest multiple of 16.

There is a neat trick to round up a number, `n`, to the nearest multiple of 16. Basically `(n + 15) & ~15`. Unfortunately, Zig makes this a pain to write because the integer type inference is not clever enough to understand `~15`.

There in the standard library is a helpful function to do that math: `std.mem.alignForward`. Kindly pointed to me by the Zig Discord. So I added this bit at the end of `replace_pseudos`.

```zig
func_def.depth = @intCast(pseudo_map.count() * 4);

const aligned = std.mem.alignForward(assembly.Instr.Depth, func_def.depth, 16);
try func_def.instrs.insert(alloc, 0, .{ .allocate_stack = aligned });
```

So, time to actually emit the assembly.

## Code Emission

The changes here are pretty small. The new instructions are one thing, but there are new registers and new register sizes for `push`, which takes 8-width registers. The logic for printing registers got pretty large so I put it in its own function.

```zig
fn emit_register(
    reg: Operand.Register,
    width: usize,
    writer: anytype,
) !void {
    p: switch (width) {
        1 => switch (reg) {
            .AX => try writer.print("%al", .{}),
            .DX => try writer.print("%dl", .{}),
            .CX => try writer.print("%cl", .{}),
            .DI => try writer.print("%dil", .{}),
            .SI => try writer.print("%sil", .{}),
            .R8 => try writer.print("%r8b", .{}),
            .R9 => try writer.print("%r9b", .{}),
            .R10 => try writer.print("%r10b", .{}),
            .R11 => try writer.print("%r11b", .{}),
        },
        4 => switch (reg) {
            .AX => try writer.print("%eax", .{}),
            .DX => try writer.print("%edx", .{}),
            .CX => try writer.print("%ecx", .{}),
            .DI => try writer.print("%edi", .{}),
            .SI => try writer.print("%esi", .{}),
            .R8 => try writer.print("%r8d", .{}),
            .R9 => try writer.print("%r9d", .{}),
            .R10 => try writer.print("%r10d", .{}),
            .R11 => try writer.print("%r11d", .{}),
        },
        8 => switch (reg) {
            .AX => try writer.print("%rax", .{}),
            .DX => try writer.print("%rdx", .{}),
            .CX => try writer.print("%rcx", .{}),
            .DI => try writer.print("%rdi", .{}),
            .SI => try writer.print("%rsi", .{}),
            .R8 => try writer.print("%r8", .{}),
            .R9 => try writer.print("%r9", .{}),
            .R10 => try writer.print("%r10", .{}),
            .R11 => try writer.print("%r11", .{}),
        },
        else => continue :p 4, // default case
    }
}
```

And then in the format function just do the following. There is a bit of redundancy regarding the 4 as a default case. You are not paranoid if they _are_ out to get you!

```zig
.reg => |r| try emit_register(r, options.width orelse 4, writer),
```

Running the test suite, I get into 16 failures. Oh come on.

Most of them seem to be `UnrecognizedFlag`, which is the error I have in the compiler driver for flags that are unrecognized. That is what I get for not reading the text and jumping straight to the tables. There is a tidbit there about recognizing a `-c` flag, which is the `gcc` flag for creating object files instead of executables.

This is a small change to the argument parser. That is the new one:

```zig

pub fn parse_args() !Args {
    var args = std.process.args();
    _ = args.skip();

    var path: ?[:0]const u8 = null;
    var mode: Mode = .compile;
    var c_flag = false; // new

    while (args.next()) |arg| {
        if (arg[0] == '-') {
            if (arg[1] == 'c') // new
                c_flag = true
            else
                mode = std.meta.stringToEnum(Mode, arg[2..]) orelse
                    return error.UnrecognizedFlag;
        } else if (path == null)
            path = arg
        else
            return error.PathDuplicated;
    }

    return .{
        .path = path orelse return error.PathNotFound,
        .mode = mode,
        .c_flag = c_flag, // new
    };
}
```

And mugh below that, when calling the assembler, the `-c` flag is passed if `c_flag` is true. And changing the extension to `.o`. So it becomes the following (changing the extension itself is done elsewhere in a bit of rather annoying code). This is probably the nicest way of doing it.

```zig
{ // assembler
    var child = std.process.Child.init(
        if (args.c_flag)
            &.{ "gcc", "-c", asm_out, "-o", obj }
        else
            &.{ "gcc", asm_out, "-o", exe },
        gpa,
    );

    const term = try child.spawnAndWait();
    if (!std.meta.eql(term, .{ .Exited = 0 }))
        return error.AssemblerFail;

    try std.fs.cwd().deleteFile(asm_out); // cleanup
}
```

Now running the test suite for real.

## Debugging

On the plud side, all the programs ar ecompiling and running. On the negative side, I got a lot of bad return codes. There are logic mistakes.
