# `paella`: C17 subset compiler

This project follows the [Writing a C Compiler book by Nora Sandler](https://norasandler.com/book/) in Zig. I have already followed the book up to a point [in Rust](https://github.com/asibahi/trjm), so this project is intended, mainly, to learn Zig.

There might be accompanying blog posts.
